## Monetization

Phase 1: Alpha/Exclusivity (Now - SmartCon)

Token-gated alpha access to liquidation automation
Community whitelisting for early supporters/partners
Build hype through limited availability

Phase 2: Publicity (SmartCon)

Speaking slot = massive credibility boost
Live demo of working liquidation automation
Press coverage as "first liquidation-based automation protocol"

Phase 3: Fair Launch Token

Public token launch captures all the attention/FOMO
Fees accrue to token holders = sustainable tokenomics
Governance over oracle parameters, new integrations

Phase 4: Scaled Clients

Use token launch liquidity + credibility to land enterprise clients
Protocol partnerships with revenue sharing
Treasury automation contracts

## GTM

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

Pay for Coinglass API ($379/mo - get the data flowing)
Build CRE automation (liquidation oracle + trigger logic)

Phase 2: Proof of Concept
3. Connect to Hyperliquid API (simplest execution venue for testing)
4. Basic dashboard (show liquidation scores + trades executing)
Phase 3: Production Ready
5. Build trading UI (Cap Finance fork with liquidation triggers)
6. Connect protocol ABIs (Euler, Nerite, Contango integrations)
7. Enhanced dashboard (full position management, analytics)
For SmartCon Demo:
You only need phases 1-2 complete. A working liquidation oracle executing trades on Hyperliquid with a basic dashboard showing it work.
Post-SmartCon:
Use the credibility to get protocol grants that fund phase 3 development.
